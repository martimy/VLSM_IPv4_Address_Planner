# VLSM_IPv4_Address_Planner

This is an app that creates an IPv4 Adderss plan using VLSM  

Variable Length Subnet Masking is a technique that allows dividing an 
IP address space to subnets of different sizes unlike simple same-size subnetting. 

# How to use

Provide major network prefix and mask, e.g. 192.168.1.0/24
Provide sizes (number of assignable ip addresses) of required subnets.
